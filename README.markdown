## Use branch 'master' this branch is not maintained anymore. RSpec-1 support is now maintained on 'master'.

Earlier RSpec-1.x support was being maintained in rspec-1 branch. This is no longer the case. We have made multiple modules(one per framework) on master(branch), and RSpec-1.x support is in a subdirectory named rspec1.

'master' is going to be the only maintained branch from now onwards, and RSpec-1.x support will be packaged out of master.
